## Why IPv6 ?

- **More addresses**. Since IPv4 has only 2^32 addresses at most, IPv6 could assign one address to every grain of sand on earth. This benefits IoT and some other modern techniques.

- **No more NAT**. Any pair of devices could connect each other directly once they are assigned with IPv6 addresses both without interruption of Network Address Translation, since the IPv6 address are unique for each device. One of the most famous application adopted this feature is the PT site.

- **More distributed Internet**. Since any two devices could be connected, there is no need to store data in centralized servers. We can distribute interested data on peers and fetch the data from some of them when we need.

- **Other**. End-to-end encryption, more secure name resolution (Secure Neighbor Discovery, SEND  protocol)...
